Linear Regression Model Performance Metrics:
    -Mean Squared Error: 0.003156977911361073
    -Mean Absolute Error: 0.04595032032644773
    -R-squared Score: 0.918822674247248

RandomForestRegressor Performance Metrics
    -Mean Squared Error: 0.0033819700002229907
    -Mean Absolute Error: 0.04593469157044498
    -R-squared Score: 0.9130373134996773

Based on the evaluation metrics, the Linear Regression model appears to be the best model for predicting burnout analysis.
It has the lower mean squared error and mean absolute error, indicating better accuracy and precision in its predictions. 
Additionally, it has the highest R-squared score, indicating a good fit to the data and explaining a higher proportion of 
the variance in the target variable.
So we will be choosing Linear Regression model for deployment.
